**(a)**
Write a Python program that accepts a student’s WASSCE result and compares it with the cut-off aggregates of the student’s first, second, and third school choices. The program should determine whether the student qualifies for their first, second, or third choice, or not at all. If the student does not qualify for any of the three, it should suggest other schools or programmes that match the student’s aggregate. **(40 marks)**

---

**(b)**
To make your program real, modify your code in (a) to load a prepared data with the Pandas package, run the program with it, and output the result in an excel sheet **(30 marks)**. For this reason, you are required to create three excel sheets:

1. An excel sheet with fictitious names and WASSCE scores. **(5 marks)**
2. An excel sheet/database with the applicant’s first, second and third choices. **(5 marks)**
3. An excel sheet with university programs and their cutoff points. **(5 marks)**

---

**(c)**
Create additional columns in the first excel sheet through your program to be used to indicate if an applicant will get her first, second or third choice after running the program. Let the program output ‘Yes’ for the choice she gets, and ‘No’ otherwise. **(10 marks).**

---

**(d)**
Also create an additional column to output a suggested programme the applicant qualifies with the grade she has. **(5 marks)**

---

**(e)**
Add any ‘beautification’ you want to make your program more real and fit for use by an institution such as University of Ghana.

**Note:**

1. You are free to be as innovative as you can.
2. There will be bonus for those who can take it up further to include a suggestion for fee paying for those who may qualify.
3. Copying and the use of AI is prohibited.

---

**Note:**
The students' data should be 50 or more. Also, the codes should be written in Jupyter Notebook. Students' ID should take the form **UG20250000**. Use **if else elif** statement in your codes.
